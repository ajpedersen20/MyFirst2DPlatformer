My First 2D Platformer
Alex Pedersen

This is a project that I created a bare-bones version of in highschool for a
java-based computer science class. Since then, I have added a couple of features
such as a menu and the leaderboard to make it a more complete project.

When the player starts the game, they enter the menu where they can choose to either
select a level, view the leaderboard, or look at the controls. There are six levels
of increasing difficulty. If the player selects level 1 from the level selection page,
the game starts with a timer to record the time for completing all six levels. The
lowest three times are recorded on the leaderboard.

Each level consists of four parts: the player which is a red cube, white platforms
which are safe to stand on, green platforms which reset the player when touched, and
a blue objective block that progresses the player when touched.

The player can traverse these levels with left and right movement, a jump, and a
left/right dash that can be used once in the air before touching the ground again to
reset it.

I developed this game using Processing which is a Java IDE used mostly for graphical
work and projects such as this.

Unfortunately the exported windows application had files greater than 100MB, so I
did not include it in this repo, but there is a demo that shows how the game works.
